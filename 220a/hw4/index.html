<p>220A Homework 4</p4>
<p>I decided to read a short part of a conversation between Prospero and Ariel from William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. It was a lot of fun watching the scene come together because I hadn't realized how much we can recreate using just sounds and pitch transpositions of one person.</p>
<p>I could improve on some of the IID and ITD between the channels if I spend more time on the quad channel machines at CCRMA, which I did not do much of. I worked primarily from my laptop so I did not play much with them.</p>
