<p>220A Homework 5</p4>
<p>I took data from the Time Series Library. The following data were used: -
	<p>MCCLEARY5.DAT
	<br>Monthly Boston armed robberies Jan.1966-Oct.1975 Deutsch and Alt (1977).
	<br>Source: McCleary and Hay (1980), and O’Donovan.
	<br>MCCLEARY7.DAT
	<br>Hyde Park purse snatchings in Chicago 28 day periods; Jan’69 – Sep ’73 Hay.
	<br>Source: McCleary and Hay (1980), and O’Donovan.
	<br>MCCLEARY10.DAT
	<br>Monthly Minneapolis public drunkenness intakes Jan.’66-Jul’78.
	<br>Source: McCleary and Hay (1980).</p>
<p> I played around with the amplitude, rate of update, and pitch. I also added an echo effect and different parameters for the JCRev and NRev. Additionally, I made the sound jump between channels based on the data based on whether it was odd or even. Finally I recorded 3 pieces :-
<p><a href="bamboozle.wav">bamboozle.wav</a></p>
<p><a href="mid_jumper.wav">mid_jumper.wav</a></p>
<p><a href="bass_echo.wav">bass_echo.wav</a></p>
<p>I played bass_echo in the rear channels for the whole duration and played bamboozle and mid_jumper in front left and right respectively. I also added a few bamboozle loops near the end for the 'solo' section once the bass echo gets relatively quiet.

<p>The final mixdown is the following file.</p>
