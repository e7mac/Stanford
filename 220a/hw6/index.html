<p>I took data from the Time Series Library. The following data were used: -
	<p>MCCLEARY5.DAT
	<br>Monthly Boston armed robberies Jan.1966-Oct.1975 Deutsch and Alt (1977).
	<br>Source: McCleary and Hay (1980), and O’Donovan.
	<br>MCCLEARY7.DAT
	<br>Hyde Park purse snatchings in Chicago 28 day periods; Jan’69 – Sep ’73 Hay.
	<br>Source: McCleary and Hay (1980), and O’Donovan.
	<br>MCCLEARY10.DAT
	<br>Monthly Minneapolis public drunkenness intakes Jan.’66-Jul’78.
	<br>Source: McCleary and Hay (1980).</p>
<p> I played around with different instruments and then the different parameters of those instruments. After exploring most of the instruments, I settled on the Mandolin, Saxofony and ModalBar. The most important thing to get an 'instrumental' sound was to play it for more than the single sample as before. If these instruments were played for just a single sample, we ended up with sounds not too different from the oscillators as before. I recorded 3 pieces :-
<p><a href="drums.wav">drums.wav</a></p>
<p><a href="saxofony.wav">saxofony.wav</a></p>
<p><a href="mandolin.wav">mandolin.wav</a></p>
<p>I made drums.wav play twice, but staggered in time, once from the front and once from the rear. The saxofony and mandolin were hard panned in stereo.

<p>The final mixdown is the following file.</p>
	
<p><a href="hw6.wav">Wave file</a></p>
