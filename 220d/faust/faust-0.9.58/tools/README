These additional tools are provided by various contributors to help 
the building process of applications and plugins with Faust. 

Currently the following tools are available :

- faust2oct is a script to create dynamically loadable functions for
  gnu octave

- faust2appls contains simple scripts to easily and quickly generate svg 
  diagrams as well as jack, alsa and plot applications

- faust2sc is a Ruby program used to generate language modules (e.g. for
  Haskell and SuperCollider).

- faust2pd is a Q program used to generate a user interface patch to
  use in conjunction with a Faust generated pd plugin.

- scbuilder is a Ruby/Python/SCons script for building SuperCollider
  plugins, either from C++ sources or from Faust specifications.

- faust2ck is a wrapper-generator for ChucK Ugens. It allows to create
  ChucK-compatible C++ code that can be placed in the Chuck source tree
  to extend the language.

- faust2flash allows to convert Faust programs into Flash .swf files
  that can be published in web pages.
