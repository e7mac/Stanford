Ideas
---------------------------------------
The idea was to create a collaborative midi system that can be used for real time jamming over the network. It borrows code from the midi homework and adds osc send/receive functionality to it. Being a minimal assignment, once I got networking functional, I decided to leave it alone. Obvious additions to the project include making it multiple people instead of just 2 and adding some sort of game feel to it - by making a rubber chicken that jumps to different people's screens and indicates that they must play something and relegate the other players to the background with maybe reducing their volume.
