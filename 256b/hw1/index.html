The Sine wave program was a simple program constructed from the tutorial material. I wanted to add something to it, so I wrote a WaveView class which would display the contents of the audio buffer at any time. The difficulty I faced was in figuring out where to refresh the WaveView. For now, I am doing it in the Acceleration callback but I have got very interesting thoughts from Ge and Mike on the mailing list. For FM, synthesis, it was a simple change of formula that was required but to get the note trigger working, I tried not using the STK Envelope and doing a "handmade" envelope instead. For the delay line, I rewrote the DelayLine class since I had a much better idea of what I wanted now than when I did it in 256a. There were 2 choices to implement the pinch - UIGestureRecognizer and Mo_Touch. Since we were using the MoMu toolkit, I decided to use Mo_Touch.
