Problem 1
---------
(a) OK

(b) OK

(c) OK
Average BFP time (block size = 4096): 0.000894


(d)
"Describe the quantization noise you hear" Discussion a bit short.
"How does floating point quantization (FP) noise sound compared to uniform quantization (MT)?" OK
"What level of uniform quantization sounds similar to 3 scale bits, 5 mantissa bits floating point quantization?" In which case is there an improvement? Of course, they are not exactly equivalent, but you could still try to see which quantizations lead to a similar noise floor (ie. around 8-10 bits as suggested by the graph in problem 2)
"How does floating point quantization compare to block floating point quantization (BFP) with different sub-block sizes?" OK though a bit short.
"What “theoretical” compression ratios do you get?" OK.
"Which quantization scheme (MT, FP, BFP) “sounds” better for a given compression ratio?" OK.

Problem 2
---------
In the 3 plots, the drop above -3dB is too steep. Check solution and graph in the book for the expected drop.
(i)
(ii)
(iii) 

Problem 3
---------
Missing
