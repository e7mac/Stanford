Problem 1
---------
(a) Despite the MDCT being called "slow" here, vectorizing the computation of each X[k] (or x[n]) was still expected in order to make it usable in a reasonable amount of time (a gain of about 10^3, still far from enough to catch up on the fast MDCT).
"Describe how each block of aliased MDCT/IMDCT output relates to its input block and describe how overlap-add will recover the input signal x[n]." A little bit too succint to capture precisely how the aliasing happens in the transform. Here is an alternative description:
The aliasing consists in:
* In the left block, the half block is reversed and substracted to itself
* In the right block, the half block is reversed and added to itself
The aliasing in the left block (resp. right) mirrors the one in the right (resp. left) block of the previous (resp. next) block, thus cancels out by overlap and add


(b) You shouldn't have multiplied the output of the imdct by 1/2 since it is not part of the transform.
"What did you need to initialize to handle the first block of input samples ([0,1,2,3])?" Zero-padded by how much?
"What did you need to do to get the last block of input samples ([3,1,-1,-3]) into the output?" Zero-padded by how much?
"Is there any delay in your output signal? How much?" OK

(c) OK

(d) OK

(e) In the x-axis, the frequency bins of the MDCT should be offset by 0.5.
"Does either transform have better frequency resolution when the same (Sine) window is used?" Not really, answering the same or that the MDCT is better would have been a much better description of what's happening on your plot.
"Does anything in this graph explain why we choose to use an FFT to do peak detection in the psychoacoustic stage instead of the MDCT?" No that's not the reason.
"Does anything explain why a Hanning window is often used for FFT analysis in the psychoacoustic stage instead of a Sine window?" No that's the contrary (the smoother the window, the larger the main lobe). Here, we're more interested in the fact that we have much less energy in sidelobes.

Problem 2
---------
(a) OK

(b) OK

(c) OK
Discussion a little bit succint, which makes it a little bit cryptic, and does not discuss the differences between FP and Uni, or between different block sizes.

Problem 3
---------
Missing (or impossible to find for me).

Problem 4
---------
(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)
