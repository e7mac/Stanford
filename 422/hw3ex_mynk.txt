I only found your cmf.py file. I assumed it was the only submission related to this problem
Problem 4
---------
(a) Missing
Prove that the power complementarity condition is satisfied if P (z) has only odd
powers of z other than the constant term which is equal to 1.

(b) Missing
show that P (z) satisfies the power complementarity condition if a,b,c,d as given
Write out the form of P (z) in terms of the angles θ and φ.

(c) Your expression of the filter is incorrect (integer division in the expression). Also, the continuous Fourier transform (that you'd have to derive by hand) was expected (cf. solution)

(d) 

(e)
