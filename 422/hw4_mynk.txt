Problem 1
---------
(a) OK
*SPL and Intensity functions

(b) 
* Graphs OK
* No numerical result provided
* The graphical result provided is hidden and mostly illegible
"How do these results compare with what you know the answer to be based on the signal definition?" Missing
"What do we learn from this exercise about how block length affects our ability to detect tonal components in a signal?" Missing

(c) OK
* Thresh function OK
* Graph OK

(d) 
* Bark function OK
* Table Missing

(e) 
* Implementation OK.Â 
* Graph OK but not very legible. The masked threshold is almost impossible to distinguish. The plotted masked threshold doesn't contain the threshold of hearing
Optimization remark: if you already know the sign of dz, no need to use the absolute value, it's slows down the code.

(f)
* AssignMDCTLinesFromFreqLimits missing the last band
* ScaleFactorBands OK
"Are there any scale factor bands for which the masked threshold exceeds the signal everywhere in the band? If so, please list them." OK

(g)
* CalcSMRs function:
    * The treatment of noise maskers is incorrect: the frequency and intensity computed are not related to the bands at all.
    * MDCTscale is not processed
"Test your SMR function by passing it a block of (unwindowed) time samples and MDCT frequency lines for the test signal you analyzed above." OK
"Given the graph you made earlier showing the masked threshold versus the DFT spectrum for each critical band, do the SMRs returned by your function make sense?" Missing
"Please provide a table showing the SMR you calculated for each scale factor band." OK

(h)
OK

Problem 2
---------
OK
