I'm sorry Fred I think you and a large number of other folks have missed what's really going on here.<br>My understanding of the situation is this, and if anyone knows anything to the contrary then I'm curious to hear it.<br>Cablevision currently pays ABC $200million a year for the privilege of receiving ABC's over the air broadcasts and then piping it down their distribution network for consumers to access.<br>The benefit to Cablevision is it carries a major station that would be crippling to have missing from its lineup - in the current model. Cablevision generates revenue directly as a result of this arrangement in at least two ways. First it sells the ABC content as part of the \"Basic Cable\" package obtaining revenue from subscribers.

There\u2019s a decent amount of evidence pointing to Cablevision having a far better grip on where they\u2019re going to be in the future Vs the likes of Comcast and Time Warner. <br>Let\u2019s start with the content wars. Cablevision has very little in terms of \u201cProprietary Content\u201d that they sell to others. What they do have are cash-cows though, unlike other plays made by cable companies to get into the content business which could be thought of as little more than getting some horses to trade.

The nice thing about this from their point of view is the heavy users like me will happily pay them for the service, and in turn free up bandwidth for the normal users.

Instead, ABC responded by asking for bandwidth in lieu of cash. This bandwidth was then used to launch channels like all of the ESPN spinoff channels, Disney XD, ABC Family, etc. In my opinion ABC is the bad guy, because they are not being honest about their position. The cut-off was meant to create maximum pain for the TV audience, knowing full well that Cablevision's front line employees would bear the brunt. This has been a tried-and-true tactic since MTV launched their \"I Want My MTV\" campaign in the early 1980s. </p>\n\n<p>But to Diginerd's other points - which are actually pretty right-on for the most part - early trials of high-speed data showed that a certain percentage of subscribers could be counted on to abuse the upstream channel. Such abuse often led to QOS issues among other cable subscribers in the same node, similar to the ingress/egress issues when people would steal cable and leave some wiring unshielded.

Instead, ABC responded by asking for bandwidth in lieu of cash. This bandwidth was then used to launch channels like all of the ESPN spinoff channels, Disney XD, ABC Family, etc. In my opinion ABC is the bad guy, because they are not being honest about their position. The cut-off was meant to create maximum pain for the TV audience, knowing full well that Cablevision's front line employees would bear the brunt. This has been a tried-and-true tactic since MTV launched their \"I Want My MTV\" campaign in the early 1980s. \n\nBut to Diginerd's other points - which are actually pretty right-on for the most part - early trials of high-speed data showed that a certain percentage of subscribers could be counted on to abuse the upstream channel. Such abuse often led to QOS issues among other cable subscribers in the same node, similar to the ingress/egress issues when people would steal cable and leave some wiring unshielded.

But, now the attention and ad revenue are moving to a very simple, little screen with a text box, no sound, characters, audience identification, or drama and just text.  As the drama people have denied for over 100 years, actually people like information more than drama.  And the ads?  No actors, music, costumes, sets, or beautifully produced, little 30 second dramas.  Instead, just still images as 'banner' ads that, net, work better for the advertisers.

Same for all the sports.  Same for the 'business' channels CNBC, Bloomberg, and BBC since they have nothing significant to do with business.  AVC DOES have to do with business and, thus, Fred, alone, with a few paragraphs a day, has more to do with business than all of cable TV.  For more, DID watch Fred's 12 little video pieces of his talk at NYU and Columbia, and they had to do with business.  Uh, get rid of Bartiromo (what has she actually done in business except tell people how to avoid the pitfalls in business she avoided by becoming a TV 'personality') and put on Fred's 12 clips instead.</p>\n\n<p>For something good, be INFORMATIVE and INSTRUCTIONAL.  E.g., have a channel on mathematical physics, from classical mechanics and Maxwell's equations through quantum mechanics, descriptive particle physics, quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory with the math done in full, correct detail!  Put on a nice college course in music appreciation, say, from Juilliard.</p>\n\n<p>Uh, Dolan, I can find and listen to Milstein playing \"Meditation\" on YouTUBE easier than I can find what's on TCM.  In a word, cable TV SUCKS.</p>\n\n<p>For traditional cable TV, an asteroid is about to strike Chicxulub.

TV has NO IDEA how little I think of their 'prime time line up'.\r\n\r\nI liked the Olympics until Bob Costas came on trying to turn it all into his favorite 'drama'; having the Olympics presented as drama I hate, bitterly.  The Olympics as described by former Olympic medal winners -- terrific!  What I REALLY want to see are the astounding accomplishments of the athletes.  The South Korean girl skating to \"Meditation\" from Massenet's 'Tha\u00efs' was fantastic, one of the best few minutes in years.  Costas, why don't you go write a great American novel and f'get about sports.\r\n\r\nUh, on violin I only made it through the first page or so of that piece, but there is an excellent performance, without the skating, at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObxzdawhM-8\r\n\r\nYup, I LIKE the Internet!  Now I'm listening to Milstein's performance at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXuzLRVi6qk\r\n\r\nWish I had a violin that good!  Maybe!\r\n\r\nA big, HUGE, irony is that the standby for over 100 years for getting attention for ads has been various cases of 'drama'; right, even the 'news' has been presented nearly always just as drama.  But, now the attention and ad revenue are moving to a very simple, little screen with a text box, no sound, characters, audience identification, or drama and just text.  As the drama people have denied for over 100 years, actually people like information more than drama.  And the ads?  No actors, music, costumes, sets, or beautifully produced, little 30 second dramas.  Instead, just still images as 'banner' ads that, net, work better for the advertisers.  A big, HUGE, shocking change.\r\n\r\nGee, if I cancel my cable TV, then I'll type software faster!\r\n\r\nDolan:  Tell Iger to take his content and stuff it.  Same for the Food Network.  Same for all the sports.  Same for the 'business' channels CNBC, Bloomberg, and BBC since they have nothing significant to do with business.  AVC DOES have to do with business and, thus, Fred, alone, with a few paragraphs a day, has more to do with business than all of cable TV.  For more, DID watch Fred's 12 little video pieces of his talk at NYU and Columbia, and they had to do with business.  Uh, get rid of Bartiromo (what has she actually done in business except tell people how to avoid the pitfalls in business she avoided by becoming a TV 'personality') and put on Fred's 12 clips instead.\r\n\r\nFor something good, be INFORMATIVE and INSTRUCTIONAL.  E.g., have a channel on mathematical physics, from classical mechanics and Maxwell's equations through quantum mechanics, detag$scriptive particle physics, quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory with the math done in full, correct detail!  Put on a nice college course in music appreciation, say, from Juilliard.\r\n\r\nUh, Dolan, I can find and listen to Milstein playing \"Meditation\" on YouTUBE easier than I can find what's on TCM.  In a word, cable TV SUCKS.\r\n\r\nFor traditional cable TV, an asteroid is about to strike Chicxulub.  Big changes.\r\n", "isHighlighted": false, "thread": "73176591", "forum": "avc", "depth": 0, "points": 1, "isEdited": true}, {"dislikes": 0, "numReports": 0, "likes": 0, "message": "<p>I remember that post.

I.e. one satellite transponder or cable head-end to thousands/millions of people at the same time.....maybe this changes....I don't know...maybe it will become \"too cheap to meter\".  They said this about electricity and it never came through, but for long distance......I guess I'd have to say for digital it could happen.\n\n2a...remember though when the marginal cost goes to zero......so does the price.  Think of the expensive \"hoot and holler\" systems brokerage companies used to have versus free conference calls today.\n\n3. There are always dislocations when the party paying for something is not the one directly receiving the benefit.  I.e. the advertiser ultimately pays but the consumer is the one that benefits....for a current controversial example thing of healthcare...\n\n3a.  If eventually the internet disintermediates.....remember....then the value to internet companies goes to zero.  Fred and I disagree how much Amazon should pay affiliates, but I would say that if the friction for transactions goes to zero..then long term the only people that make money are the producers/sellers and any commissions go to zero, as buyers pay the rock bottom price.\n\nTherefore long term the only way a multi-tiered distribution model works if it provides efficiency.  I.e. Walmart does because their distribution system makes it cheaper for them to ship tractor trailers of stuff to a store and me pick it up.....However see my point number 2.....if there is no cost to ship....they go away.  In the non-digital world there is always friction....not so sure in the digital world.\n\nThis is not to say you can't make money.......making phones, routers, switches, software....just not as a percentage of what is sold.", "isHighlighted": false, "thread": "73176591", "forum": "avc", "depth": 0, "points": 1, "isEdited": true}, {"dislikes": 0, "numReports": 0, "likes": 1, "message": "<p>Must carry rules and retransmission consent apply to television stations, not to television networks.

                        <p>Fred, there is a lot to cover in this debate. you have just touched on part of it. Not sure I agree with you that the current retrans dispute is a result of the monopoly status. more likely the loss of advertising revenues and a change in fcc policy on must-carry obligations. This debate has many ins and outs and neither side is free from greed. </p>

<p>personally, I find the most interesting dimension is the fact that content owners are asking for more money with one hand from one distributor and simultaneously offering the same content online with far lesser economic demands. This is the only element of the debate that doesn't follow pure economic logic. </p>

<p>On over the top, I agree on all points except that I wouldn't expect the middle man role to be nearly as attractive/lucrative with digital goods as it is in the physical economy. In a world where consumers have frictionless access via multiple middlemen with zero marginal costs, there will be no profit in content aggregation. Consumer wins, content wins. It might be three tiered for a while, unless the middle guy adds real value beyond aggregation, not sure it stays that way for long.</p>

<p>this is precisely why cable needs to get out of the video business and focus exclusively on the ISP business. Afterall, they do have a monopoly. </p>

                        <p>Bugger missed a key point... Look at the triple play bundles that are being sold. 2/3 of it is for providing a data network. If you're looking on ROI running a good data network is highly profitable and not subject to being held hostage to content providers wasnting "Retransmission Fees" for delivering the same content via QAM. If you extend ABCs current logic they will be asking all the ISPs to pay them for the privilege of providing the "Free" service they provide.</p>

<p>I'd rather run a great ISP instead of making TV shows, it's a steady gig. For every hit there's raft of cancelled shows.</p>

                        <p>Agreed.  Simply cannot come soon enough.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, since there's so much money at stake, and since going direct to consumers won't always replace the lost revenue, it will likely take a while.</p>

<p>One way to break it down faster would be for a new entrant to raise a bunch of money and pay big retransmission fees long before it has the consumer subscriptions to back them up.  This will make the risk for the content providers less--and they'll therefore be willing to risk pissing off the cable companies.  Right now, they're so scared of losing distribution that they sign away the rights to the content in particular markets (all rights, not just cable rights).  That needs to break down, and the fastest way to make it happen is to have an over-the-top provider be able to pay big fees from the get-go.</p>

<p>The second piece is a simple set-top box.  The consumer needs to be able to stuff an ethernet cord in the back of the box and have it work as simply and easily as a cable box.  Until we have that, consumers just won't jump on board.  Consumers HATE complexity, and the current over-the-top solutions are just ridiculously complicated.</p>

                        <p>good points henry, particularly about the content companies reluctance to take the plunge</p>

<p>one way around retrans fees is to use the digital over the air broadcast as a bridge</p>

<p>i also think we won't be using set top boxed anymore.</p>

<p>it will be internet connected big screen tvs running appletv, boxee, or something else</p>

<p>what if they all came with a digital over the air antenna and receiver?</p>

                        <p>My head spins thinking about the ramifications of all video programming being delivered via over the top and broadcast signal. Jon Smirl is right that the infrastructure can't handle it. It will require fiber to every home and a tremendous amount of backbone construction. The signals today are being delivered via satellite. When I think of the hardware investment that will be scrapped, it's overwhelming. Buy fiber investments and datacenters...</p>

                        <p>i've thought so much about the efficiency of broadcast and how we are going to scrap so much of our investment in it. but that's is the power of a two way medium over a one way medium. one way simply cannot compete unless it can be elegantly paired with a back channel.</p>

                        <p>I haven't heard of that one, but there are many in the design or construction phase in relatively low density/rural/suburban areas like Lafayette. I would venture all are publicly funded or heavily subsidized. Utilities have a very low cost of money and a need to invest free cash flows (so the government owner won't repurpose them to the general fund). Most utilities have very little additional investment to do in the electrical plant, so fiber is a good option with the smart grid potential etc. In addition, their ROI needs are much lower than a private entity concerned about creating value for shareholders. </p>

<p>We've had to transition from a phone company only concerned about ensuring a dial tone is there when a receiver is picked up to a provider of a large menu of services over a broadband, cable and voice connection (with combined twisted pair, HFC and fiber network). It will be interesting to watch utility providers make the same transition. The muni utility in Memphis where I currently live couldn't do it and ended up selling it's fiber assets to Zayo for a song.</p>

                        <p>Fred have you seen the DTT (digital terrestrial)/broadband "hybrid" set top boxes and services they are rolling out in the UK (Bestv), Spain, elsewhere.</p>

<p>It's an inexpensive box (~$100 one-time fee) the user plugs into the wall.  No installation required.  15-30 channels (can be configured to only the ones you want).  Time shifting.  Feedback loop via broadband.  </p>

<p>Focuses on the low end of the market -- people sick of paying cable or satellite bills (or whose needs are simple and with the analog/digi switchover they can't use their bunny ears anymore).</p>

<p>But these boxes could be configured to any logical, consumer-based bundle (kids, sports, porn, etc.)</p>

<p>The core tech offers quite a bit of flexibility about how to marketize.  </p>

                        <p>Professional sports - particularly the NFL - provides a potential way for a new entrant to make a splash with the least risk. Use NFL games as a tentpole and stop wasting on-air promotion on a single destination show - promote show concepts that the viewer might actually like. After all, It can't be any more of a crapshoot than NBC's upcoming fall schedule. </p>

<p>The battles between the NFL and its players are akin to the battle between Cablevision and ABC - both are about indirectly shifting risk to the consumer. While consumers hate complexity, I argue both episodic TV and entire TV networks often need time to find their legs -- time that they might not get in a hyperefficient market. After all, CNN's 24-hour news model was widely viewed as a testament to Ted Turner's hubris for years, until interest in the first Gulf War changed American viewing habits for good.  </p>

                        <p>I think I am watching the endgame for cable TV right now. As I stream the NCAA tournament in HQ on my computer, I do wonder, how long can it be until the middle man (read cable and satellite providers) are completely cut out of the equation and all TV content is "streamable"? All the content providers need is a reliable third party to measure the usage and advertisers will fall right in line.

                        <p>We are going to be in europe for the saturday NCAA semifinal games in two weeks. My son josh said 'dad, what are we gonna do?'. I said 'its streaming live on the web'. And he said 'are we going to have to proxy our IP address to watch?'</p>

<p>He's 14</p>

<p>The whole conversation was surreal in terms of how far we've come and the hurdles that still exist</p>

<p>I don't know the answer to his last question but I sure hope that it is no</p>

                        <p>Hopefully Boxee and my friends who are now buying Netflix incorporated hardware will change this power monopolies.  Interestingly just like happened with land line phones, a few of my friends have cancelled their cable and moved to netflix type boxes.  Control of content will be more huge.</p>

                        <p>I hate to defend Cablevision but I have to side with them on this. I'm sorry Fred I think you and a large number of other folks have missed what's really going on here.<br>My understanding of the situation is this, and if anyone knows anything to the contrary then I'm curious to hear it.<br>Cablevision currently pays ABC $200million a year for the privilege of receiving ABC's over the air broadcasts and then piping it down their distribution network for consumers to access.<br>The benefit to Cablevision is it carries a major station that would be crippling to have missing from its lineup - in the current model. Cablevision generates revenue directly as a result of this arrangement in at least two ways. First it sells the ABC content as part of the "Basic Cable" package obtaining revenue from subscribers. I’m not sure what the margin is on delivery of basic cable, but I’ll bet it’s less than people think.<br>Secondly it has the right to insert a certain number of "Local" commercials in various slots. Of course it sells these slots to local businesses.<br>ABC on the other hand gets the $200Million as payment for allowing Cablevision to carry its channels. It also gets to add 3 Million subscribers to its footprint which in turn has an impact on Neilson ratings and as a result it can charge more for its commercials. <br>By ABC's own admission there are multiple ways that their content cab be received for free should the deadline expire and no agreement is reached. This raises the question why do they feel the need for a 20% price hike? The consensus is commercial revenues have fallen off a cliff. Those blanket commercials about this would have no room if there were paid ones to fill their place, and so ABC is seeking to maintain its net revenue stream.<br>Cablevision simply can’t fold in this situation and fork out the requested cash. If it did its costs would have risen at the same time it has been suffering from the same downturn in sales of airtime. It might be able to do it once or twice, but if it did then every content provider shark would smell the blood in the water and use exactly the same tactics. Murdoch’s Fox empire would be right at the front of the line and after even more money than ABC.<br>The net result is Cablevision will have to put up its prices to keep paying the piper. If you look at their filings I suspect this has been behind many of the hikes to date and not as a result of the “Greed Monopoly” theory.<br>Anyway, this isn't the end of the story by a long way (Thanks if you’re still reading). There are a couple of other things about this situation that are worth noting. Let's start with ABC's point that they have been discussing this issue with Cablevision for 2 years. <br>Assuming that's true (No evidence to the contrary) then why is there all of a sudden urgency to this matter on the eve of the Oscars? </p>

<p>This smells like hardball escalation tactics by ABC and in the process they're trying to frame out Cablevision as the bad guys when ABC is the rights holder. It is indeed theirs to call alone if the show goes on or not. Cablevision desperately needs ABC and they wouldn't slit their own throats by voluntarily turning off the channel. <br>However there's also no way Cablevision will retransmit anything without ABC's approval because to do so would destroy the company in a heartbeat. If a content delivery network cannot follow the letter of the law then no one will deal with it. This is on top of all kinds of legal fun that would come from such an action.<br>ABC has got Cablevision by the short and curlies and is looking to leverage public perception into forcing capitulation. Or have they?<br>Something that must be preying on the minds of the Disney execs right now is the fact that Cablevision have previously held their position in the face of public outcry and the loss of many customers over a similar situation with HGTV not so long ago. <br>There’s huge difference between HGTV and ABC though – Practically all the content created by ABC is available for free on line. HGTV is a premium channel that many folks love and their content certainly isn’t up on their website to the same extent that ABC’s it. I certainly don’t want to be chaged more for the same content when it’s available for “Free” online…<br>This brings us onto the main point in Fred’s article. What does the future look like? <br>The people at Cablevision have certainly been thinking about this too. I’m not sure exactly when it happened but if you look at the contrarian postures and approaches they’ve been taking in the past couple of years I’d say they’ve been banking on everyone underestimating them as the same old brain dead company they always were. There’s a decent amount of evidence pointing to Cablevision having a far better grip on where they’re going to be in the future Vs the likes of Comcast and Time Warner. <br>Let’s start with the content wars. Cablevision has very little in terms of “Proprietary Content” that they sell to others. What they do have are cash-cows though, unlike other plays made by cable companies to get into the content business which could be thought of as little more than getting some horses to trade. Content alone is tough to use as a bargaining chip, there’s no upside for anyone in public fights.<br>Where Cablevision really have differentiated themselves against the other cable companies and AT&amp;T’s uVerse product (FiOS to a point as well) is in their approach to the Internet. There was a time when they were being heavy handed with subscribers over the amount of traffic that was being consumed. In fact they were by far the most draconian company in the industry.<br>This has changed. Now Cablevision has a 100MBit offering, and if you’re willing to pay for it you get what you expect. I have Ultra myself and I’m mightily impressed with it. I get to paid to run a very large computer network and to get equivalent service outside of Cablevision’s footprint is going to cost thousands of dollars a month. The nice thing about this from their point of view is the heavy users like me will happily pay them for the service, and in turn free up bandwidth for the normal users. Talk of bandwidth in this case is a little unnecessary as the recent overhaul they gone through their network is now in the position of being able to support a future where the majority of their subscribers don’t take a tv package.<br>I haven’t had TV from them for 3 years, there’s no need as I can get everything I want over the Internet (Legally I might add!). Although I have no wish to, I could be watching the Oscars tomorrow evening on Cablevision’s network even if ABC pulls the plug.<br>They’re not ready for everyone to drop TV yet, but you can see the pieces coming into position. One of the key indicators is what their competition are doing. AT&amp;T uVerse is based on DSL and as such their network is not going to be able to provide subscribers with enough bandwidth to meet there needs in a few years time. Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done to mitigate this other than forklift their entire edge network and start over.<br>FIOS isn’t available in my area, but if it was I still wouldn’t take it. Sure Fiber is “Better” than “Crusty coax” but that’s smoke and mirrors. There’s more than enough capacity in the cable for quite a long time and just because Fiber lets you run Gigabit I don’t see an offering from Verizon anytime soon. I also like not having a contract and having to take TV service to get the sportiest Internet on the East coast<br>This is for the same reasons you won’t be sing similar totally unlimited offerings from Time Warner and Comcast anytime soon. Their plan for the future looks to be based on selling traditional airtime and licensing their expanding content creation divisions. . Both of them put severe restrictions on the total amount of data you may download a month. They sell this as “Protecting the network” (Cablevisions old line actually), and that no normal consumer could possibly need 250 GB of data a month for a valid reason.<br>Either their networks aren’t very well deployed (Possible for sure!), or there’s an ulterior motive in play which is driving them to cap bandwidth. A first though would be the obvious one of “Preventing piracy”, which certainly is a strong driver. <br>On the other hand it serves another very useful purpose for the cable companies. It effectively stifles take up of high quality streaming of HDTV as a replacement of a TV package. Those moves that Netflix rents online aren’t small. Watch a bunch and you could be looking at sending very short emails (unlike this post, thanks again for sticking with it!) for the rest of the month until the cap resets. That means you’re more likely to keep your expensive movie package once your experiment with the future is sabotaged. While we’re at it those shows you’re watching over the Internet aren’t making the cable company any money through commercial sales. This comes full circle to ABC. If there’s falling revenue from the content then they need to find another way to monetize it and make up the short fall.<br>On the other hand Cablevision appears to have worked out what it needs to differentiate itself from the other players. By having killer internet they’ve effectively hedged against ABC, FOX and whoever comes next. Further evidence of this is their new “Computer channel” which allows you to stream the likes of Netflix, HULU and ABC’s online web content right to your STB if you haven’t hooked it up directly. </p>

<p>To address Henry's point about complexity, the latest generation of HDTVs are coming with an ethernet port to allow you to stream content from the internet right to your TV...</p>

<p>I’m sure Disney likes this as much as they do Cablevisions upcoming network DVR. I doubt it’s enough to trigger the present ABC fireworks display, but I’d bet a nickel it’s a consideration.<br>The whole media industry is going through a significant period of entropy and those that make the right calls will survive and the ones that don’t won’t.<br></p>

                        <p>Currently, DIS does not get paid for the retransmission of WABC - the station in question - except for perhaps some advertising time that Cablevision provides. That is what this argument is about. The $40M that Cablevision references is equal to $1 per Cablevision sub per month multiplied by the roughly 3.5M Cablevision subs in the NYC area. The $200M referenced is solely related to Disney's other properties such as ESPN (primarily) as well as the Disney Channel etc...</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>The first round of retransmission/consent started from the position that Cablevision et al. would pay ABC for the right to carry their signal. Instead, ABC responded by asking for bandwidth in lieu of cash. This bandwidth was then used to launch channels like all of the ESPN spinoff channels, Disney XD, ABC Family, etc. In my opinion ABC is the bad guy, because they are not being honest about their position. The cut-off was meant to create maximum pain for the TV audience, knowing full well that Cablevision's front line employees would bear the brunt. This has been a tried-and-true tactic since MTV launched their "I Want My MTV" campaign in the early 1980s. </p>

<p>But to Diginerd's other points - which are actually pretty right-on for the most part - early trials of high-speed data showed that a certain percentage of subscribers could be counted on to abuse the upstream channel. Such abuse often led to QOS issues among other cable subscribers in the same node, similar to the ingress/egress issues when people would steal cable and leave some wiring unshielded. Rate limiting the upstream channel was the most elegant solution to addressing this problem. </p>

<p>And lastly, for all of you people that seem to desire a hyperefficient marketplace where you can buy exactly the programming you want, be careful what you wish for. Most of today's popular shows required some form of subsidy to give them time to find their audience. That is one reason why YouTube - after years of trial and error and enormous outside investments - has been spectacularly unsuccessful at launching a single TV programming concept that could be considered a hit, much less coming close to stinkers like "Eli Stone" or "Pushing Daisies". </p>

                        <p>Fair point. The odds of the general public getting a handle on the situation is near zero..</p>

<p>The next question then is what "Programming" does ABC7 provide to warrant this fee, instead of it going to the parent (Disney). Obviously local news and weather shows, butI'm trying to get a clear understanding of where ABC7 is coming from. </p>

<p>A significant amount of resources are consumed in order for cablevision to provide ABC on the screens of 3 million viewers. As I mentioned before, ABC7 gets a HUGE amount of commercial advantage by having this population watching its shows and therefore its commercials.</p>

<p>Cablevisions "Basic Cable" package is $16.72 in Lower Fairfield county. If you subscribe to it you gai acces to 64 channels. Strip out the duplcates (HD / Std Def) and there are 51 distinct channels as part of the package. ONE of which is ABC. It looks like Accuweather got pulled from the lineup already (I'm sourcing my data from Cablevision's site as I don't have a TV subscription myself, Just monster Internet). I'm curous how much it actually costs to provide the infrastructre to give ABC it's audence, not going to happen so short of speculating wildly there's no way we'll be able descern what's an appropriate level of compensation for ABC.</p>

<p>Personally I don't think it should be much given the costs incurred by CV to provide the huge benefit to ABC by having an extra 3 million viewers due to this arrangement and in addition there's a clear double standard when it comes to streaming content insest of "Broadcast". That said given how little I know about the inner workings of these organizations it could be that ABC is being very reasonable. They haven't done themselves any favors in the manner PR for this has been handled.</p>

<p>In a lttle over 2 hours she should hav an answer though.</p>

<p>Anyway, the price any (Non "small") Cable operator charges is regulated by the local franchise comission (Hence the variation in price in CT and NY). Cablevison may petition about it, but they certainly don't chose how much they get to charge for it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/csgen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/cs...</a></p>

<p>There is another deeper issue at play here too. If we follow reductio ad absurdum with ABC's arguement they should be targetting every ISP who has the gall to be the dumb pipe allowing their programming to be shown via the internet. Why is it clear to everyone I ask that the ISP is simply the transit and ABC gains materially from this arrangement.</p>

<p>In the case of Cablevision's retransmission of the NY feed I guess it comes down to how many commercial slots they're allowed to use for their own purposes. That is certainly a key factor, but if ABC's revenues are down just imagine how Cablevision is feeling after the mess when Scrippps pulled this stunt with PREMIUM CONTENT, not over the air content that is generating revenue for the content creator.</p>

                        <p>OK hang on Fred.  Now you want to microchunk the healthcare system too? The consumer gets to decide which treatments he thinks will work best for him?  It's not the same as choosing one or two tracks from the latest Kings of Leon album.  Personally I'd be happy to cut ESPN out of my cable bill.  Because I don't think DIS or TW have made a compelling case.  And I'm not really that concerned about the survival of the incumbent content providers or distributors.  But taking a microchunk approach to healthcare is truly a leap of faith.  Especially given the poor record American consumers have put up recently in the housing crisis. For sure the healthcare system is broken.  Anarchy isn't the solution.</p>

                        <p>You hit a spot that is very sore for me personally but also, to some extent, positive for the business I am starting.</p>

<p>You have to be correct that the 'content' now provided via cable MUST become available on demand over the Internet.  I've recently watched some movies over the Internet from Hulu and Veoh, and the quality is fine.</p>

<p>ABC, NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, CBS, CNN, PBS, and Fox may be shocked to learn how little I think of their content, how little I watch them, and how often they make me angry where I click away.  Actually, about all I ever watch is Fox News, Fox movies, TCM, and PBS.  While I can like a good movie, the rest I regard as at the bottom of the barrel or lower.  I'd very much like some science programming, but I've found nothing worth watching on science on TV for years.  On the Internet, sure!  Prime time TV dramas?  Haven't watched one this century.  TV has NO IDEA how little I think of their 'prime time line up'.</p>

<p>I liked the Olympics until Bob Costas came on trying to turn it all into his favorite 'drama'; having the Olympics presented as drama I hate, bitterly.  The Olympics as described by former Olympic medal winners -- terrific!  What I REALLY want to see are the astounding accomplishments of the athletes.  The South Korean girl skating to "Meditation" from Massenet's 'Thaïs' was fantastic, one of the best few minutes in years.  Costas, why don't you go write a great American novel and f'get about sports.</p>

<p>Uh, on violin I only made it through the first page or so of that piece, but there is an excellent performance, without the skating, at</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObxzdawhM-8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v...</a></p>

<p>Yup, I LIKE the Internet!  Now I'm listening to Milstein's performance at</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXuzLRVi6qk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v...</a></p>

<p>Wish I had a violin that good!  Maybe!</p>

<p>A big, HUGE, irony is that the standby for over 100 years for getting attention for ads has been various cases of 'drama'; right, even the 'news' has been presented nearly always just as drama.  But, now the attention and ad revenue are moving to a very simple, little screen with a text box, no sound, characters, audience identification, or drama and just text.  As the drama people have denied for over 100 years, actually people like information more than drama.  And the ads?  No actors, music, costumes, sets, or beautifully produced, little 30 second dramas.  Instead, just still images as 'banner' ads that, net, work better for the advertisers.  A big, HUGE, shocking change.</p>

<p>Gee, if I cancel my cable TV, then I'll type software faster!</p>

<p>Dolan:  Tell Iger to take his content and stuff it.  Same for the Food Network.  Same for all the sports.  Same for the 'business' channels CNBC, Bloomberg, and BBC since they have nothing significant to do with business.  AVC DOES have to do with business and, thus, Fred, alone, with a few paragraphs a day, has more to do with business than all of cable TV.  For more, DID watch Fred's 12 little video pieces of his talk at NYU and Columbia, and they had to do with business.  Uh, get rid of Bartiromo (what has she actually done in business except tell people how to avoid the pitfalls in business she avoided by becoming a TV 'personality') and put on Fred's 12 clips instead.</p>

<p>For something good, be INFORMATIVE and INSTRUCTIONAL.  E.g., have a channel on mathematical physics, from classical mechanics and Maxwell's equations through quantum mechanics, descriptive particle physics, quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory with the math done in full, correct detail!  Put on a nice college course in music appreciation, say, from Juilliard.</p>

<p>Uh, Dolan, I can find and listen to Milstein playing "Meditation" on YouTUBE easier than I can find what's on TCM.  In a word, cable TV SUCKS.</p>

<p>For traditional cable TV, an asteroid is about to strike Chicxulub.  Big changes.<br></p>

                        <p>I remember that post.  I dug into the Atlantic article and was ummm unimpressed. You say that single payer is your preferred option and if not that some hybrid guided by consumer choice.  k. The key assumption is that first there's going to be a government-run catastrophic health insurance safety net.  Then we can bring in consumer choice, transparency et al to refine the system.  But getting govt.-financed catastrophic coverage would be enormously difficult.  I'm not sure the insurers wd necessarily be against it but the other players in the medical-insuarnce complex definitely don't want the feds setting prices.  For example, last December my father in law spent the last three months of his life being kicked from nursing home to hospital to rehab center.  All at enormous cost to Medicare and to his extended pain and suffering.  Oh and he contracted MRSA in the hospital before they kicked him to their controlled rehab center.  They refused to let him be transferred to a lower cost (out of their network) hospice.  He had six weeks to live and they kept him in their high cost "rehab" center even though he had highly contagious MRSA.  And we're talking about Wake Med in Raleigh not some 3rd tier place.</p>

<p>But that's really not the point.  After the fiasco of the mortgage crisis, isn't it obvious that consumers don't have the information or bargaining power to bargain with hospitals, doctors and insurance companies? The individual consumer is at an even steeper disadvantage when dealing with health crises.</p>

<p>So sure bring the consumer into the equation.  We've seen some press about that the last few weeks.  But it's a tiny part of the solution to the larger problem of health care reform.  When someone self-insures, he has a fool for an insurance company. Usually.   </p>

                        <p>First, Fred’s conclusion is right... Ultimately consumers will have more choices of distributors through which to get Disney’s content.  What’s not clear is whether that system will support the quality of content consumers have today (and yes, I know the twittersphere predicts everyone will be happy with just “Funny or Die” – I don’t believe that).  I think its pretty clear that the superdistribution world ends up generating LESS total revenue for the content owner....  It may be there’s too much content produced today and we’ll be fine with less, but that’s not yet obvious.</p>

<p>A few observations about why this debate gets confusing, especially for consumers...<br>Fred complains there’s no other way today to get Disney other than thru Cablevision and thus consumers lose – that’s not exactly right because many Cablevision households can choose today choose from FiOS, DirectTV and DISH as well as Cablevision.  Cablevision knows how much competition there already is - otherwise they wouldn’t settle with Disney on New Years Eve.   They'd hold out much much longer.</p>

<p>Cablevision’s drawing a line in the sand on New Years Eve with Disney actually benefits consumers...  The reason Cablevision resists is because Disney wants jack its rates HIGHER than the consumer rate increases at Cablevision.  If you look at the GROSS MARGIN of the video business of the cable/telco industry, it has dropped ~5% in each of the last 3 years, even while cable prices have been raised about ~5% per year.  The reason for that is that programming conglomerates (Disney, Viacom, CBS, Fox) have amassed a lot of networks and thus wield more power on New Years Eve than they did 10 years ago....  E.g., “if you don’t pay me more for ObscureNetworkX, you can’t have ABC”.  Or if you don’t charge EVERY subscriber for ESPN (not just the ones that want sports), you can’t have Disney Channel.  Analysts are predicting that retransmission consent will cost the cable/telco $Bill in additional programming fees per year in the next year or two without getting one more piece of content for us, its subscribers.  Are we saying we're pissed at Cablecos because they won't absorb all that?  Will we expect Boxee to?</p>

<p>So, cable companies are making less per video customer every year despite rate increases to consumers – that pretty much tells me that the content owners are winning the standoff and cablecos lose.  And consumers are losing because they’re also paying some of it.  Sure, an a la carte world will be better for consumers (except ESPN lovers who will have to bear ALL the costs of ESPN, not the subsidized cost ESPN enables today by charging the sports-indifferent), but its not clear that CONTENT OWNERS want that.  Replace Cablevision with Boxee and do you really have a different dynamic with the content juggernaut, or just a different interface on your TV?  Yes, your video subscription might drop from $80 to $40, but there will be less choice and your broadband will cost $100.  What was gained?</p>

                        <p>boxee won't absorb it because they won't be a distributor. they'll be a retailer in the three tier model.</p>

<p>consumers either will absorb it or they won't. but at least it will be transparent to them. they'll decide if they want to pay another $1/month to watch the oscars. some will. some won't.</p>

                        <p>Fred, as an Internet VC, you're advocating inserting a 3-tiered model in an industry that is currently 2-tiered?  I thought the Internet was all about DISINTERMEDIATION.  Sounds like all that does is LESSEN the power of the consumer and the retailer in fighting the bullying tactics of the content owners who have all the power right now.  I know why that would help Boxee, but not sure why that helps me.</p>

                        <p>I'm not smart enough to figure out how it will end up but I would point out a couple of things as a former telcom guy, then software guy, now marketing software guy.</p>

<p>1. Whenever I see telcom/cable companies not embracing that they are in fact a dumb pipe....it really annoys me.  Does the water company care if you brew the most expensive whiskey with their water or it goes down a leaky toilet?  How about the electric company.....do they care if I'm using it to power my super profitable trading algorithms running on a computer or sitting with a light bulb on I don't know about it in my basement.....live with it....you're a dumb pipe.  It doesn't matter whether I'm on a super important business call or just a blathering teenager.....</p>

<p>2. As somebody pointed out video is more efficient point to multipoint.  I.e. one satellite transponder or cable head-end to thousands/millions of people at the same time.....maybe this changes....I don't know...maybe it will become "too cheap to meter".  They said this about electricity and it never came through, but for long distance......I guess I'd have to say for digital it could happen.</p>

<p>2a...remember though when the marginal cost goes to zero......so does the price.  Think of the expensive "hoot and holler" systems brokerage companies used to have versus free conference calls today.</p>

<p>3. There are always dislocations when the party paying for something is not the one directly receiving the benefit.  I.e. the advertiser ultimately pays but the consumer is the one that benefits....for a current controversial example thing of healthcare...</p>

<p>3a.  If eventually the internet disintermediates.....remember....then the value to internet companies goes to zero.  Fred and I disagree how much Amazon should pay affiliates, but I would say that if the friction for transactions goes to zero..then long term the only people that make money are the producers/sellers and any commissions go to zero, as buyers pay the rock bottom price.</p>

<p>Therefore long term the only way a multi-tiered distribution model works if it provides efficiency.  I.e. Walmart does because their distribution system makes it cheaper for them to ship tractor trailers of stuff to a store and me pick it up.....However see my point number 2.....if there is no cost to ship....they go away.  In the non-digital world there is always friction....not so sure in the digital world.</p>

<p>This is not to say you can't make money.......making phones, routers, switches, software....just not as a percentage of what is sold.</p>

                        <p>Must carry rules and retransmission consent apply to television stations, not to television networks.  The four major TV networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX) own television stations in top markets, so the current fight between Cablevision and ABC is not with Disney, per se, but with the ABC-owned local TV station in New York (WABC-TV, Channel 7).</p>

                        <p>I work for a small, rural cable provider. We know the content will ultimately be delivered on demand, over-the-top via a broadband connection. We embrace this. We would love to give consumers a la carte programming but the content providers make it economically impossible. Want the station that everyone else wants? It costs more for that one than it does for these 40. The valid argument for that is that bundled programming pays for developing niche stations that wouldn't get big view numbers but have a rabid following--generally higher quality programming that the masses don't watch. In reality, a la carte cable programming would push the niche content to over-the-top. A good thing in my opinion, but the 5 big video content providers can't figure out how to make money there.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, the cable business--especially anything beyond bare-bones, basic cable that requires a box (digital, HD, etc)--has very low margins due to what content providers charge per subscriber. Retransmission fees for programming that has historically been free via broadcast are a fact of life. I can't speak to the Cablevision-WABC-Disney issue directly without specific knowledge of the deal obviously, but I do know that Disney--via the ESPN franchise--has historically been the most "creative" at generating revenue from cable and ISPs (see ESPN360). They are the programming monopoly. Consumers have plenty of choices in most cases for video programming (Direct and Dish in our market; add Verizon and ATT in NYC). To me, its analogous to Yahoo charging an ISP for its content I would love another perspective on that convincing me otherwise.</p>

<p>We are seeing over-the-top (Netflix and Hulu mainly) drive demand for our higher bandwidth residential products just as we are seeing private cloud (i.e. wide area networking) drive demand for our fiber. We welcome the future as long as we can remain a valuable service provider and not a dumb pipe. We are working hard to make that a reality.</p>

                        <p>Cable TV is a fascinating business on a number of different planes.  I suspect that the accounting approach of capitalizing the development of the physical plant and valuing it at some multiple of plant in the ground (an idea undone by the actual pricing of several bankruptcies) means that cable TV has never made anybody any money unless they sold it to a bigger fool.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is a wonderful example of "convergence" whereby tv begat cable tv which begat bundled internet, phone and security services whch begat the unbundling and de-convergence of cell phone service.</p>

<p>I suspect in 20 years every bit of what is today delivered by cable is delivered via satellite.  Direct TV is the first wave of a tsunamai as the burgeoning and unlimited capacity and technology of the airwaves overwhelms the limitations of the pipe.</p>

                        <p>Broadband via satellite? It will be a very long time (longer than 20 years in my opinion) before an unwired connection can deliver the content consumers desire whether that's wireless or satellite. I would love to read more about the potential technologies that promise to deliver a fiber-like connection without fiber.</p>

<p>The bottom line regarding your cable bankruptcies comment: it's rare, if not impossible, to find a successful private company that has constructed a network to the home in a non-urban market without significant government assistance.</p>

                        <p>Very interesting. AS you mention, in the cable companies I look at broadband service carries about an 80% EBITDA margin, VOIP telephony higher than that - and video is the lowest margin business of all - at under 30% - depending on scale. It would make logical sense - if one could do it - to simple get rid of all the bandwidth eaten up by the analog channels and bind more and more QAM's together for higher and higher speed data. You could probably then do digital switching on al the other QAM's and and dedicate a certain amount of pipe for perhaps the top 20 cable channels (using some sort of digital encryprtion for conditional access) and everything else can go through VOD. Cable would then not be a dumb pipe - but an intelligent pipe.</p>

                        <p>Nice post Fred. A VP from Disney/ABC came and spoke to my class at NYU Stern a few days ago and spoke very little about customers -- unless he was talking about piracy or how new forms of consumption are hurting their revenue. They see us as the problem, not the answer. Tweeted this right after:</p>

                        <p>I'm going to respectfully disagree with my NYU Stern classmate.  I don't think Disney sees customers as the problem, they see the revenue potential of current digital distribution methods as the problem. </p>

<p>I think media content owners like Disney, Scripps, and Fox would very happily distribute directly to consumers (or through channels like Boxee and Roku) if those distribution channels offered an equivalent revenue opportunity to the existing cable/satellite distribution schemes.</p>

<p>There seems to be an opportunity in this space in being the firm that creates the exchange that gives consumers the choice between "dozens, maybe hundreds of providers" for entertainment content while also providing content creators with enough revenue to create high quality content without requiring exorbitant subscription rates for each of these providers.</p>

                        <p>all we need to do is provide Disney, Scripps and Fox unbundled over the internet and i think we'll see plenty of demand for their content at per subscriber price points that may dwarf what they are getting from the cable companies today</p>

                        <p>Agreed, but I think this is just Step #1 in the substitution cycle.</p>

<p>I don't doubt that Disney could charge, let's say $25/mo, for unbundled access to their Disney, ESPN, and ABC family of channels.  Scripps could probably charge $5/mo for Food Network &amp; HGTV.  NBC Universal might get $15/mo for it's set of networks.  As a consumer, buying all these unbundled options is going to add up really quickly, and consumers will have a lot less choice because niche networks simply won't be able to acquire enough subscribers to continue to produce content.</p>

<p>As a Cablevision subscriber I can get access to to 290 channels for $80/mo.  Sure, there might be 240 channels in my current cable package that I never watch, but every Cablevision subscriber is getting more choice for less money than we'll be getting in the initial stages of the unbundled world.</p>

<p>That's why I think the next stage after unbundling has to involve ways to bundle packages of consumers instead of packages of channels so that there is wide enough distribution to keep costs low and choice high.<br></p>

                        <p>What I never understand at all is the argument that a la carte will kill peoples choice in programming and then somehow equating that with a negative outcome. If I never watch Oxygen, why would I want to subsidize it. Should there be some right to programming that very few people watch. I always thought that these niche channels should be built up on VOD platforms or over the top platforms. Sure programming quality might be lower than what you see - but if the premise of the programming catches on - programmers can then put more and more money into production. If you look at most marginal channels - there are 1-2 shows per channel that actually attract an audience of any size and the rest is just filler and repeats. A good example might be something like Showtime - which I pay probably $6 per month for (it is bundled on Directv with other movie channels) - but really only watch Dexter and Tudors. So For $72 per year - I generally get 24 episodes in total of these shows - or $3 per episode - plus the option on any movies I might catch. Can I replicate this by using the DVD market - for sure. </p>

<p>i think we'll see bundlers who focus on young men, young women, kids,<br>techies, film buffs, etc, etc</p>

<p>i totally agree that consumers don't want to buy all their channels ala<br>carte</p>

<p>i think we'll see dozens if not hundreds of bundlers</p>

<p>they'll be like cable companies without the cable and they'll compete in an<br>open market with each other for our business</p>

                        <p>If you think about it, that's what has happened w/ air travel.  Bundlers or pseudo bundlers (Kayak, Orbitz, Expedia) are basically selling "excess inventory" but of a finite inventory.</p>

<p>Media bundlers and pseudo-bundlers can sell "excess inventory" of an infinite inventory.  Making each individual transaction minute in comparison to the overall market.</p>

<p>Every TV turned off is idle inventory which can be accessed by making the marginal cost very, very, very low. </p>

                        <p>Airline tickets are equivlent.  TV shows aren't in the same way.  The spark of creativity that causes people to be connected to some and not others is very hard to capture.  We're not sure completely how the formula works (as in you can make a formulaic show and it still won't last...no one knows quite why)</p>

<p>What will be the "excess" inventory then?</p>

                        <p>I'm not suggesting consumers would pay more for a la carte access.  If I can buy the dozen channels I watch for &lt; a DirecTV package, I'd do it.</p>

                        <p>We'll have a lot of demand to be sure: in the beginning we won't know what to make and what it's cost should be.  I keep thinking in the back of my head, unless you have a really good way of targeting cheaply customers cheap content, there is no way lots of high quality content is going to flow.  certain kinds of content will just rise in price as information overflows and hides this stuff away.</p>

<p>It is extremely hard to quantify creativity at its peak- it is what makes valuing art so difficult. It's going to be a mess for a very long while when we debundle, that's for sure...</p>

                        <p>That's interesting to consider, Fred. Will they pay cable providers for access to the networks or will cable providers pay them? Or will it be delivered with a direct to consumer model with the broadband provider only delivering the content (like the web today)?</p>

                        <p>here's the way i see it gregg, but you are closer to the front lines than i am</p>

<p>1) cable will be data providers plain and simple. they could be bundlers too and probably will maintain one that some of their customers will subscribe to.</p>

<p>2) bundlers will emerge that will handle most of the distribution and customer acquisition</p>

<p>3) networks will offer an ala carte single network subscription</p>

<p>4) the retailers will be the software that runs on the internet connected TVs, appleTV, boxee, and others</p>

Not sure I agree with you that the current retrans dispute is a result of the monopoly status. more likely the loss of advertising revenues and a change in fcc policy on must-carry obligations. This debate has many ins and outs and neither side is free from greed. </p>

<p>personally, I find the most interesting dimension is the fact that content owners are asking for more money with one hand from one distributor and simultaneously offering the same content online with far lesser economic demands. This is the only element of the debate that doesn't follow pure economic logic. </p>

<p>On over the top, I agree on all points except that I wouldn't expect the middle man role to be nearly as attractive/lucrative with digital goods as it is in the physical economy. In a world where consumers have frictionless access via multiple middlemen with zero marginal costs, there will be no profit in content aggregation. Consumer wins, content wins. It might be three tiered for a while, unless the middle guy adds real value beyond aggregation, not sure it stays that way for long.</p>

<p>this is precisely why cable needs to get out of the video business and focus exclusively on the ISP business. Afterall, they do have a monopoly. </p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:41933933">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-41933933">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-41933564">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="1128772">                <img src="avatar92.jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="1128772">George A.</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-41933564" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>Hi fred, there is a lot to cover in this debate. you have just touched on part of it.

Afterall, they do have a monopoly. </p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:41933564">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-41933564">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-38359795">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar">            <div class="user"><img src="avatar.php" class="user" alt="Avatar"></div>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="name">Diginerd, Fairfield County, CT</span>                                                <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38359795" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>Bugger missed a key point... Look at the triple play bundles that are being sold. 2/3 of it is for providing a data network. If you're looking on ROI running a good data network is highly profitable and not subject to being held hostage to content providers wasnting "Retransmission Fees" for delivering the same content via QAM. If you extend ABCs current logic they will be asking all the ISPs to pay them for the privilege of providing the "Free" service they provide.</p>

<p>I'd rather run a great ISP instead of making TV shows, it's a steady gig. For every hit there's raft of cancelled shows.</p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime"

Simply cannot come soon enough.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, since there's so much money at stake, and since going direct to consumers won't always replace the lost revenue, it will likely take a while.</p>

<p>One way to break it down faster would be for a new entrant to raise a bunch of money and pay big retransmission fees long before it has the consumer subscriptions to back them up.  This will make the risk for the content providers less--and they'll therefore be willing to risk pissing off the cable companies.  Right now, they're so scared of losing distribution that they sign away the rights to the content in particular markets (all rights, not just cable rights).  That needs to break down, and the fastest way to make it happen is to have an over-the-top provider be able to pay big fees from the get-go.</p>

<p>The second piece is a simple set-top box.  The consumer needs to be able to stuff an ethernet cord in the back of the box and have it work as simply and easily as a cable box.  Until we have that, consumers just won't jump on board.  Consumers HATE complexity, and the current over-the-top solutions are just ridiculously complicated.</p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38285313">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-3" data-role="likes">3</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38285313">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-38286577">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="45">                <img src="avatar92(1).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="45">fredwilson</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38286577" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>good points henry, particularly about the content companies reluctance to take the plunge</p>

<p>one way around retrans fees is to use the digital over the air broadcast as a bridge</p>

<p>i also think we won't be using set top boxed anymore.</p>

<p>it will be internet connected big screen tvs running appletv, boxee, or something else</p>

I would venture all are publicly funded or heavily subsidized. Utilities have a very low cost of money and a need to invest free cash flows (so the government owner won't repurpose them to the general fund). Most utilities have very little additional investment to do in the electrical plant, so fiber is a good option with the smart grid potential etc. In addition, their ROI needs are much lower than a private entity concerned about creating value for shareholders. </p>

<p>We've had to transition from a phone company only concerned about ensuring a dial tone is there when a receiver is picked up to a provider of a large menu of services over a broadband, cable and voice connection (with combined twisted pair, HFC and fiber network). It will be interesting to watch utility providers make the same transition. The muni utility in Memphis where I currently live couldn't do it and ended up selling it's fiber assets to Zayo for a song.</p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38351520">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-1" data-role="likes">1</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38351520">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-38564030">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="307117">                <img src="avatar92(4).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="307117">Tereza</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38564030" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>Fred have you seen the DTT (digital terrestrial)/broadband "hybrid" set top boxes and services they are rolling out in the UK (Bestv), Spain, elsewhere.</p>

<p>It's an inexpensive box (~$100 one-time fee) the user plugs into the wall.  No installation required.  15-30 channels (can be configured to only the ones you want).  Time shifting.  Feedback loop via broadband.  </p>

<p>Focuses on the low end of the market -- people sick of paying cable or satellite bills (or whose needs are simple and with the analog/digi switchover they can't use their bunny ears anymore).</p>

<p>But these boxes could be configured to any logical, consumer-based bundle (kids, sports, porn, etc.)</p>

<p>The core tech offers quite a bit of flexibility about how to marketize.  </p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38564030">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38564030">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-38665396">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="45">                <img src="avatar92(1).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="45">fredwilson</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38665396" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>We are going to be in a post set-top box world very soon.

Use NFL games as a tentpole and stop wasting on-air promotion on a single destination show - promote show concepts that the viewer might actually like. After all, It can't be any more of a crapshoot than NBC's upcoming fall schedule. </p>

<p>The battles between the NFL and its players are akin to the battle between Cablevision and ABC - both are about indirectly shifting risk to the consumer. While consumers hate complexity, I argue both episodic TV and entire TV networks often need time to find their legs -- time that they might not get in a hyperefficient market. After all, CNN's 24-hour news model was widely viewed as a testament to Ted Turner's hubris for years, until interest in the first Gulf War changed American viewing habits for good.  </p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38798345">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38798345">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-40384755">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="2304134">                <img src="avatar92(6).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="2304134">Tom Dougherty</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-40384755" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>I think I am watching the endgame for cable TV right now. As I stream the NCAA tournament in HQ on my computer, I do wonder, how long can it be until the middle man (read cable and satellite providers) are completely cut out of the equation and all TV content is "streamable"? All the content providers need is a reliable third party to measure the usage and advertisers will fall right in line.

I'm sorry Fred I think you and a large number of other folks have missed what's really going on here.<br>My understanding of the situation is this, and if anyone knows anything to the contrary then I'm curious to hear it.<br>Cablevision currently pays ABC $200million a year for the privilege of receiving ABC's over the air broadcasts and then piping it down their distribution network for consumers to access.<br>The benefit to Cablevision is it carries a major station that would be crippling to have missing from its lineup - in the current model. Cablevision generates revenue directly as a result of this arrangement in at least two ways. First it sells the ABC content as part of the "Basic Cable" package obtaining revenue from subscribers. I’m not sure what the margin is on delivery of basic cable, but I’ll bet it’s less than people think.<br>Secondly it has the right to insert a certain number of "Local" commercials in various slots. Of course it sells these slots to local businesses.<br>ABC on the other hand gets the $200Million as payment for allowing Cablevision to carry its channels. It also gets to add 3 Million subscribers to its footprint which in turn has an impact on Neilson ratings and as a result it can charge more for its commercials. <br>By ABC's own admission there are multiple ways that their content cab be received for free should the deadline expire and no agreement is reached. This raises the question why do they feel the need for a 20% price hike? The consensus is commercial revenues have fallen off a cliff. Those blanket commercials about this would have no room if there were paid ones to fill their place, and so ABC is seeking to maintain its net revenue stream.<br>Cablevision simply can’t fold in this situation and fork out the requested cash. If it did its costs would have risen at the same time it has been suffering from the same downturn in sales of airtime. It might be able to do it once or twice, but if it did then every content provider shark would smell the blood in the water and use exactly the same tactics. Murdoch’s Fox empire would be right at the front of the line and after even more money than ABC.<br>The net result is Cablevision will have to put up its prices to keep paying the piper. If you look at their filings I suspect this has been behind many of the hikes to date and not as a result of the “Greed Monopoly” theory.<br>Anyway, this isn't the end of the story by a long way (Thanks if you’re still reading). There are a couple of other things about this situation that are worth noting. Let's start with ABC's point that they have been discussing this issue with Cablevision for 2 years. <br>Assuming that's true (No evidence to the contrary) then why is there all of a sudden urgency to this matter on the eve of the Oscars? </p>

<p>This smells like hardball escalation tactics by ABC and in the process they're trying to frame out Cablevision as the bad guys when ABC is the rights holder. It is indeed theirs to call alone if the show goes on or not. Cablevision desperately needs ABC and they wouldn't slit their own throats by voluntarily turning off the channel. <br>However there's also no way Cablevision will retransmit anything without ABC's approval because to do so would destroy the company in a heartbeat. If a content delivery network cannot follow the letter of the law then no one will deal with it. This is on top of all kinds of legal fun that would come from such an action.<br>ABC has got Cablevision by the short and curlies and is looking to leverage public perception into forcing capitulation. Or have they?<br>Something that must be preying on the minds of the Disney execs right now is the fact that Cablevision have previously held their position in the face of public outcry and the loss of many customers over a similar situation with HGTV not so long ago. <br>There’s huge difference between HGTV and ABC though – Practically all the content created by ABC is available for free on line. HGTV is a premium channel that many folks love and their content certainly isn’t up on their website to the same extent that ABC’s it. I certainly don’t want to be chaged more for the same content when it’s available for “Free” online…<br>This brings us onto the main point in Fred’s article. What does the future look like? <br>The people at Cablevision have certainly been thinking about this too. I’m not sure exactly when it happened but if you look at the contrarian postures and approaches they’ve been taking in the past couple of years I’d say they’ve been banking on everyone underestimating them as the same old brain dead company they always were. There’s a decent amount of evidence pointing to Cablevision having a far better grip on where they’re going to be in the future Vs the likes of Comcast and Time Warner. <br>Let’s start with the content wars. Cablevision has very little in terms of “Proprietary Content” that they sell to others. What they do have are cash-cows though, unlike other plays made by cable companies to get into the content business which could be thought of as little more than getting some horses to trade. Content alone is tough to use as a bargaining chip, there’s no upside for anyone in public fights.<br>Where Cablevision really have differentiated themselves against the other cable companies and AT&amp;T’s uVerse product (FiOS to a point as well) is in their approach to the Internet. There was a time when they were being heavy handed with subscribers over the amount of traffic that was being consumed. In fact they were by far the most draconian company in the industry.<br>This has changed. Now Cablevision has a 100MBit offering, and if you’re willing to pay for it you get what you expect. I have Ultra myself and I’m mightily impressed with it. I get to paid to run a very large computer network and to get equivalent service outside of Cablevision’s footprint is going to cost thousands of dollars a month. The nice thing about this from their point of view is the heavy users like me will happily pay them for the service, and in turn free up bandwidth for the normal users. Talk of bandwidth in this case is a little unnecessary as the recent overhaul they gone through their network is now in the position of being able to support a future where the majority of their subscribers don’t take a tv package.<br>I haven’t had TV from them for 3 years, there’s no need as I can get everything I want over the Internet (Legally I might add!). Although I have no wish to, I could be watching the Oscars tomorrow evening on Cablevision’s network even if ABC pulls the plug.<br>They’re not ready for everyone to drop TV yet, but you can see the pieces coming into position. One of the key indicators is what their competition are doing. AT&amp;T uVerse is based on DSL and as such their network is not going to be able to provide subscribers with enough bandwidth to meet there needs in a few years time. Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done to mitigate this other than forklift their entire edge network and start over.<br>FIOS isn’t available in my area, but if it was I still wouldn’t take it. Sure Fiber is “Better” than “Crusty coax” but that’s smoke and mirrors. There’s more than enough capacity in the cable for quite a long time and just because Fiber lets you run Gigabit I don’t see an offering from Verizon anytime soon. I also like not having a contract and having to take TV service to get the sportiest Internet on the East coast<br>This is for the same reasons you won’t be sing similar totally unlimited offerings from Time Warner and Comcast anytime soon. Their plan for the future looks to be based on selling traditional airtime and licensing their expanding content creation divisions. . Both of them put severe restrictions on the total amount of data you may download a month. They sell this as “Protecting the network” (Cablevisions old line actually), and that no normal consumer could possibly need 250 GB of data a month for a valid reason.<br>Either their networks aren’t very well deployed (Possible for sure!), or there’s an ulterior motive in play which is driving them to cap bandwidth. A first though would be the obvious one of “Preventing piracy”, which certainly is a strong driver. <br>On the other hand it serves another very useful purpose for the cable companies. It effectively stifles take up of high quality streaming of HDTV as a replacement of a TV package. Those moves that Netflix rents online aren’t small. Watch a bunch and you could be looking at sending very short emails (unlike this post, thanks again for sticking with it!) for the rest of the month until the cap resets. That means you’re more likely to keep your expensive movie package once your experiment with the future is sabotaged. While we’re at it those shows you’re watching over the Internet aren’t making the cable company any money through commercial sales. This comes full circle to ABC. If there’s falling revenue from the content then they need to find another way to monetize it and make up the short fall.<br>On the other hand Cablevision appears to have worked out what it needs to differentiate itself from the other players. By having killer internet they’ve effectively hedged against ABC, FOX and whoever comes next. Further evidence of this is their new “Computer channel” which allows you to stream the likes of Netflix, HULU and ABC’s online web content right to your STB if you haven’t hooked it up directly. </p>

<p>To address Henry's point about complexity, the latest generation of HDTVs are coming with an ethernet port to allow you to stream content from the internet right to your TV...</p>

<p>I’m sure Disney likes this as much as they do Cablevisions upcoming network DVR. I doubt it’s enough to trigger the present ABC fireworks display, but I’d bet a nickel it’s a consideration.<br>The whole media industry is going through a significant period of entropy and those that make the right calls will survive and the ones that don’t won’t.<br></p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime"

Instead, ABC responded by asking for bandwidth in lieu of cash. This bandwidth was then used to launch channels like all of the ESPN spinoff channels, Disney XD, ABC Family, etc. In my opinion ABC is the bad guy, because they are not being honest about their position. The cut-off was meant to create maximum pain for the TV audience, knowing full well that Cablevision's front line employees would bear the brunt. This has been a tried-and-true tactic since MTV launched their "I Want My MTV" campaign in the early 1980s. </p>

<p>But to Diginerd's other points - which are actually pretty right-on for the most part - early trials of high-speed data showed that a certain percentage of subscribers could be counted on to abuse the upstream channel. Such abuse often led to QOS issues among other cable subscribers in the same node, similar to the ingress/egress issues when people would steal cable and leave some wiring unshielded. Rate limiting the upstream channel was the most elegant solution to addressing this problem. </p>

<p>And lastly, for all of you people that seem to desire a hyperefficient marketplace where you can buy exactly the programming you want, be careful what you wish for. Most of today's popular shows required some form of subsidy to give them time to find their audience. That is one reason why YouTube - after years of trial and error and enormous outside investments - has been spectacularly unsuccessful at launching a single TV programming concept that could be considered a hit, much less coming close to stinkers like "Eli Stone" or "Pushing Daisies". </p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38799903">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38799903">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-38393433">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar">            <div class="user"><img src="avatar(2).php" class="user" alt="Avatar"></div>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="name">Diginerd</span>                                                <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38393433" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>Fair point. The odds of the general public getting a handle on the situation is near zero..</p>

<p>The next question then is what "Programming" does ABC7 provide to warrant this fee, instead of it going to the parent (Disney). Obviously local news and weather shows, butI'm trying to get a clear understanding of where ABC7 is coming from. </p>

<p>A significant amount of resources are consumed in order for cablevision to provide ABC on the screens of 3 million viewers. As I mentioned before, ABC7 gets a HUGE amount of commercial advantage by having this population watching its shows and therefore its commercials.</p>

<p>Cablevisions "Basic Cable" package is $16.72 in Lower Fairfield county. If you subscribe to it you gai acces to 64 channels. Strip out the duplcates (HD / Std Def) and there are 51 distinct channels as part of the package. ONE of which is ABC. It looks like Accuweather got pulled from the lineup already (I'm sourcing my data from Cablevision's site as I don't have a TV subscription myself, Just monster Internet). I'm curous how much it actually costs to provide the infrastructre to give ABC it's audence, not going to happen so short of speculating wildly there's no way we'll be able descern what's an appropriate level of compensation for ABC.</p>

<p>Personally I don't think it should be much given the costs incurred by CV to provide the huge benefit to ABC by having an extra 3 million viewers due to this arrangement and in addition there's a clear double standard when it comes to streaming content insest of "Broadcast". That said given how little I know about the inner workings of these organizations it could be that ABC is being very reasonable. They haven't done themselves any favors in the manner PR for this has been handled.</p>

<p>In a lttle over 2 hours she should hav an answer though.</p>

<p>Anyway, the price any (Non "small") Cable operator charges is regulated by the local franchise comission (Hence the variation in price in CT and NY). Cablevison may petition about it, but they certainly don't chose how much they get to charge for it.</p>

<p>There is another deeper issue at play here too. If we follow reductio ad absurdum with ABC's arguement they should be targetting every ISP who has the gall to be the dumb pipe allowing their programming to be shown via the internet. Why is it clear to everyone I ask that the ISP is simply the transit and ABC gains materially from this arrangement.</p>

<p>In the case of Cablevision's retransmission of the NY feed I guess it comes down to how many commercial slots they're allowed to use for their own purposes. That is certainly a key factor, but if ABC's revenues are down just imagine how Cablevision is feeling after the mess when Scrippps pulled this stunt with PREMIUM CONTENT, not over the air content that is generating revenue for the content creator.</p>

Now you want to microchunk the healthcare system too? The consumer gets to decide which treatments he thinks will work best for him?  It's not the same as choosing one or two tracks from the latest Kings of Leon album.  Personally I'd be happy to cut ESPN out of my cable bill.  Because I don't think DIS or TW have made a compelling case.  And I'm not really that concerned about the survival of the incumbent content providers or distributors.  But taking a microchunk approach to healthcare is truly a leap of faith.  Especially given the poor record American consumers have put up recently in the housing crisis.

<p>You have to be correct that the 'content' now provided via cable MUST become available on demand over the Internet.  I've recently watched some movies over the Internet from Hulu and Veoh, and the quality is fine.</p>

<p>ABC, NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, CBS, CNN, PBS, and Fox may be shocked to learn how little I think of their content, how little I watch them, and how often they make me angry where I click away.  Actually, about all I ever watch is Fox News, Fox movies, TCM, and PBS.  While I can like a good movie, the rest I regard as at the bottom of the barrel or lower.  I'd very much like some science programming, but I've found nothing worth watching on science on TV for years.  On the Internet, sure!  Prime time TV dramas?  Haven't watched one this century.  TV has NO IDEA how little I think of their 'prime time line up'.</p>

<p>I liked the Olympics until Bob Costas came on trying to turn it all into his favorite 'drama'; having the Olympics presented as drama I hate, bitterly.  The Olympics as described by former Olympic medal winners -- terrific!  What I REALLY want to see are the astounding accomplishments of the athletes.  The South Korean girl skating to "Meditation" from Massenet's 'Thaïs' was fantastic, one of the best few minutes in years.  Costas, why don't you go write a great American novel and f'get about sports.</p>

<p>Uh, on violin I only made it through the first page or so of that piece, but there is an excellent performance, without the skating, at</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObxzdawhM-8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v...</a></p>

<p>Yup, I LIKE the Internet!  Now I'm listening to Milstein's performance at</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXuzLRVi6qk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v...</a></p>

<p>Wish I had a violin that good!  Maybe!</p>

<p>A big, HUGE, irony is that the standby for over 100 years for getting attention for ads has been various cases of 'drama'; right, even the 'news' has been presented nearly always just as drama.  But, now the attention and ad revenue are moving to a very simple, little screen with a text box, no sound, characters, audience identification, or drama and just text.  As the drama people have denied for over 100 years, actually people like information more than drama.  And the ads?  No actors, music, costumes, sets, or beautifully produced, little 30 second dramas.  Instead, just still images as 'banner' ads that, net, work better for the advertisers.  A big, HUGE, shocking change.</p>

<p>Gee, if I cancel my cable TV, then I'll type software faster!</p>

<p>Dolan:  Tell Iger to take his content and stuff it.  Same for the Food Network.  Same for all the sports.  Same for the 'business' channels CNBC, Bloomberg, and BBC since they have nothing significant to do with business.  AVC DOES have to do with business and, thus, Fred, alone, with a few paragraphs a day, has more to do with business than all of cable TV.  For more, DID watch Fred's 12 little video pieces of his talk at NYU and Columbia, and they had to do with business.  Uh, get rid of Bartiromo (what has she actually done in business except tell people how to avoid the pitfalls in business she avoided by becoming a TV 'personality') and put on Fred's 12 clips instead.</p>

<p>For something good, be INFORMATIVE and INSTRUCTIONAL.  E.g., have a channel on mathematical physics, from classical mechanics and Maxwell's equations through quantum mechanics, descriptive particle physics, quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory with the math done in full, correct detail!  Put on a nice college course in music appreciation, say, from Juilliard.</p>

<p>Uh, Dolan, I can find and listen to Milstein playing "Meditation" on YouTUBE easier than I can find what's on TCM.  In a word, cable TV SUCKS.</p>

I dug into the Atlantic article and was ummm unimpressed. You say that single payer is your preferred option and if not that some hybrid guided by consumer choice.  k. The key assumption is that first there's going to be a government-run catastrophic health insurance safety net.  Then we can bring in consumer choice, transparency et al to refine the system.  But getting govt.-financed catastrophic coverage would be enormously difficult.  I'm not sure the insurers wd necessarily be against it but the other players in the medical-insuarnce complex definitely don't want the feds setting prices.  For example, last December my father in law spent the last three months of his life being kicked from nursing home to hospital to rehab center.  All at enormous cost to Medicare and to his extended pain and suffering.  Oh and he contracted MRSA in the hospital before they kicked him to their controlled rehab center.  They refused to let him be transferred to a lower cost (out of their network) hospice.  He had six weeks to live and they kept him in their high cost "rehab" center even though he had highly contagious MRSA.  And we're talking about Wake Med in Raleigh not some 3rd tier place.</p>

<p>But that's really not the point.  After the fiasco of the mortgage crisis, isn't it obvious that consumers don't have the information or bargaining power to bargain with hospitals, doctors and insurance companies? The individual consumer is at an even steeper disadvantage when dealing with health crises.</p>

<p>So sure bring the consumer into the equation.  We've seen some press about that the last few weeks.  But it's a tiny part of the solution to the larger problem of health care reform.  When someone self-insures, he has a fool for an insurance company. Usually.   </p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38718514">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38718514">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-38399665">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar">            <div class="user"><img src="avatar(3).php" class="user" alt="Avatar"></div>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="name">Economics101</span>                                                <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38399665" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>First, Fred’s conclusion is right... Ultimately consumers will have more choices of distributors through which to get Disney’s content.  What’s not clear is whether that system will support the quality of content consumers have today (and yes, I know the twittersphere predicts everyone will be happy with just “Funny or Die” – I don’t believe that).  I think its pretty clear that the superdistribution world ends up generating LESS total revenue for the content owner....  It may be there’s too much content produced today and we’ll be fine with less, but that’s not yet obvious.</p>

<p>A few observations about why this debate gets confusing, especially for consumers...<br>Fred complains there’s no other way today to get Disney other than thru Cablevision and thus consumers lose – that’s not exactly right because many Cablevision households can choose today choose from FiOS, DirectTV and DISH as well as Cablevision.  Cablevision knows how much competition there already is - otherwise they wouldn’t settle with Disney on New Years Eve.   They'd hold out much much longer.</p>

<p>Cablevision’s drawing a line in the sand on New Years Eve with Disney actually benefits consumers...  The reason Cablevision resists is because Disney wants jack its rates HIGHER than the consumer rate increases at Cablevision.  If you look at the GROSS MARGIN of the video business of the cable/telco industry, it has dropped ~5% in each of the last 3 years, even while cable prices have been raised about ~5% per year.  The reason for that is that programming conglomerates (Disney, Viacom, CBS, Fox) have amassed a lot of networks and thus wield more power on New Years Eve than they did 10 years ago....  E.g., “if you don’t pay me more for ObscureNetworkX, you can’t have ABC”.  Or if you don’t charge EVERY subscriber for ESPN (not just the ones that want sports), you can’t have Disney Channel.  Analysts are predicting that retransmission consent will cost the cable/telco $Bill in additional programming fees per year in the next year or two without getting one more piece of content for us, its subscribers.  Are we saying we're pissed at Cablecos because they won't absorb all that?  Will we expect Boxee to?</p>

<p>So, cable companies are making less per video customer every year despite rate increases to consumers – that pretty much tells me that the content owners are winning the standoff and cablecos lose.  And consumers are losing because they’re also paying some of it.  Sure, an a la carte world will be better for consumers (except ESPN lovers who will have to bear ALL the costs of ESPN, not the subsidized cost ESPN enables today by charging the sports-indifferent), but its not clear that CONTENT OWNERS want that.  Replace Cablevision with Boxee and do you really have a different dynamic with the content juggernaut, or just a different interface on your TV?  Yes, your video subscription might drop from $80 to $40, but there will be less choice and your broadband will cost $100.  What was gained?</p>

I thought the Internet was all about DISINTERMEDIATION.  Sounds like all that does is LESSEN the power of the consumer and the retailer in fighting the bullying tactics of the content owners who have all the power right now.

<p>1. Whenever I see telcom/cable companies not embracing that they are in fact a dumb pipe....it really annoys me.  Does the water company care if you brew the most expensive whiskey with their water or it goes down a leaky toilet?  How about the electric company.....do they care if I'm using it to power my super profitable trading algorithms running on a computer or sitting with a light bulb on I don't know about it in my basement.....live with it....you're a dumb pipe.  It doesn't matter whether I'm on a super important business call or just a blathering teenager.....</p>

<p>2. As somebody pointed out video is more efficient point to multipoint.  I.e. one satellite transponder or cable head-end to thousands/millions of people at the same time.....maybe this changes....I don't know...maybe it will become "too cheap to meter".  They said this about electricity and it never came through, but for long distance......I guess I'd have to say for digital it could happen.</p>

<p>2a...remember though when the marginal cost goes to zero......so does the price.  Think of the expensive "hoot and holler" systems brokerage companies used to have versus free conference calls today.</p>

<p>3. There are always dislocations when the party paying for something is not the one directly receiving the benefit.  I.e. the advertiser ultimately pays but the consumer is the one that benefits....for a current controversial example thing of healthcare...</p>

<p>3a.  If eventually the internet disintermediates.....remember....then the value to internet companies goes to zero.  Fred and I disagree how much Amazon should pay affiliates, but I would say that if the friction for transactions goes to zero..then long term the only people that make money are the producers/sellers and any commissions go to zero, as buyers pay the rock bottom price.</p>

<p>Therefore long term the only way a multi-tiered distribution model works if it provides efficiency.  I.e. Walmart does because their distribution system makes it cheaper for them to ship tractor trailers of stuff to a store and me pick it up.....However see my point number 2.....if there is no cost to ship....they go away.  In the non-digital world there is always friction....not so sure in the digital world.</p>

<p>This is not to say you can't make money.......making phones, routers, switches, software....just not as a percentage of what is sold.</p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38370092">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-1" data-role="likes">1</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38370092">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-38308506">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="30806">                <img src="noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="30806">chwarner</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38308506" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>Must carry rules and retransmission consent apply to television stations, not to television networks.

We know the content will ultimately be delivered on demand, over-the-top via a broadband connection. We embrace this. We would love to give consumers a la carte programming but the content providers make it economically impossible. Want the station that everyone else wants? It costs more for that one than it does for these 40. The valid argument for that is that bundled programming pays for developing niche stations that wouldn't get big view numbers but have a rabid following--generally higher quality programming that the masses don't watch. In reality, a la carte cable programming would push the niche content to over-the-top. A good thing in my opinion, but the 5 big video content providers can't figure out how to make money there.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, the cable business--especially anything beyond bare-bones, basic cable that requires a box (digital, HD, etc)--has very low margins due to what content providers charge per subscriber. Retransmission fees for programming that has historically been free via broadcast are a fact of life. I can't speak to the Cablevision-WABC-Disney issue directly without specific knowledge of the deal obviously, but I do know that Disney--via the ESPN franchise--has historically been the most "creative" at generating revenue from cable and ISPs (see ESPN360). They are the programming monopoly. Consumers have plenty of choices in most cases for video programming (Direct and Dish in our market; add Verizon and ATT in NYC). To me, its analogous to Yahoo charging an ISP for its content I would love another perspective on that convincing me otherwise.</p>

<p>We are seeing over-the-top (Netflix and Hulu mainly) drive demand for our higher bandwidth residential products just as we are seeing private cloud (i.e. wide area networking) drive demand for our fiber. We welcome the future as long as we can remain a valuable service provider and not a dumb pipe. We are working hard to make that a reality.</p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38288527">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-1" data-role="likes">1</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38288527">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-38331168">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="108783">                <img src="avatar92(11).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="108783">JLM</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38331168" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>Cable TV is a fascinating business on a number of different planes.  I suspect that the accounting approach of capitalizing the development of the physical plant and valuing it at some multiple of plant in the ground (an idea undone by the actual pricing of several bankruptcies) means that cable TV has never made anybody any money unless they sold it to a bigger fool.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is a wonderful example of "convergence" whereby tv begat cable tv which begat bundled internet, phone and security services whch begat the unbundling and de-convergence of cell phone service.</p>

<p>I suspect in 20 years every bit of what is today delivered by cable is delivered via satellite.  Direct TV is the first wave of a tsunamai as the burgeoning and unlimited capacity and technology of the airwaves overwhelms the limitations of the pipe.</p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38331168">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-2" data-role="likes">2</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38331168">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-38352122">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="17606">                <img src="avatar92(3).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="17606">Gregg Smith</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38352122" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>Broadband via satellite? It will be a very long time (longer than 20 years in my opinion) before an unwired connection can deliver the content consumers desire whether that's wireless or satellite. I would love to read more about the potential technologies that promise to deliver a fiber-like connection without fiber.</p>

<p>The bottom line regarding your cable bankruptcies comment: it's rare, if not impossible, to find a successful private company that has constructed a network to the home in a non-urban market without significant government assistance.</p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38352122">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38352122">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-38373462">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="5967">                <img src="avatar92(8).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="5967">Harry DeMott</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38373462" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>Very interesting. AS you mention, in the cable companies I look at broadband service carries about an 80% EBITDA margin, VOIP telephony higher than that - and video is the lowest margin business of all - at under 30% - depending on scale. It would make logical sense - if one could do it - to simple get rid of all the bandwidth eaten up by the analog channels and bind more and more QAM's together for higher and higher speed data. You could probably then do digital switching on al the other QAM's and and dedicate a certain amount of pipe for perhaps the top 20 cable channels (using some sort of digital encryprtion for conditional access) and everything else can go through VOD. Cable would then not be a dumb pipe - but an intelligent pipe.</p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38373462">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38373462">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-38289348">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="45">                <img src="avatar92(1).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="45">fredwilson</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38289348" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p>gregg</p>

A VP from Disney/ABC came and spoke to my class at NYU Stern a few days ago and spoke very little about customers -- unless he was talking about piracy or how new forms of consumption are hurting their revenue. They see us as the problem, not the answer. Tweeted this right after:</p>

I don't think Disney sees customers as the problem, they see the revenue potential of current digital distribution methods as the problem. </p>

<p>I think media content owners like Disney, Scripps, and Fox would very happily distribute directly to consumers (or through channels like Boxee and Roku) if those distribution channels offered an equivalent revenue opportunity to the existing cable/satellite distribution schemes.</p>

<p>There seems to be an opportunity in this space in being the firm that creates the exchange that gives consumers the choice between "dozens, maybe hundreds of providers" for entertainment content while also providing content creators with enough revenue to create high quality content without requiring exorbitant subscription rates for each of these providers.</p>

substitution cycle.</p>

<p>I don't doubt that Disney could charge, let's say $25/mo, for unbundled access to their Disney, ESPN, and ABC family of channels.  Scripps could probably charge $5/mo for Food Network &amp; HGTV.  NBC Universal might get $15/mo for it's set of networks.  As a consumer, buying all these unbundled options is going to add up really quickly, and consumers will have a lot less choice because niche networks simply won't be able to acquire enough subscribers to continue to produce content.</p>

<p>As a Cablevision subscriber I can get access to to 290 channels for $80/mo.  Sure, there might be 240 channels in my current cable package that I never watch, but every Cablevision subscriber is getting more choice for less money than we'll be getting in the initial stages of the unbundled world.</p>

<p>That's why I think the next stage after unbundling has to involve ways to bundle packages of consumers instead of packages of channels so that there is wide enough distribution to keep costs low and choice high.<br></p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38288480">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-1" data-role="likes">1</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38288480">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-38373866">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="5967">                <img src="avatar92(8).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="5967">Harry DeMott</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38373866" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p><a href="http://disqus.com/UnsatisfiedMind/" class="mention">UnsatisfiedMind:&nbsp;</a>What I never understand at all is the argument that a la carte will kill peoples choice in programming and then somehow equating that with a negative outcome. If I never watch Oxygen, why would I want to subsidize it. Should there be some right to programming that very few people watch. I always thought that these niche channels should be built up on VOD platforms or over the top platforms. Sure programming quality might be lower than what you see - but if the premise of the programming catches on - programmers can then put more and more money into production. If you look at most marginal channels - there are 1-2 shows per channel that actually attract an audience of any size and the rest is just filler and repeats. A good example might be something like Showtime - which I pay probably $6 per month for (it is bundled on Directv with other movie channels) - but really only watch Dexter and Tudors. So For $72 per year - I generally get 24 episodes in total of these shows - or $3 per episode - plus the option on any movies I might catch. Can I replicate this by using the DVD market - for sure. </p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38373866">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38373866">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li><li class="post" id="post-38289257">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="45">                <img src="avatar92(1).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="45">fredwilson</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38289257" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p><a href="http://disqus.com/UnsatisfiedMind/" class="mention">UnsatisfiedMind:&nbsp;</a>when i said "providers" in my post, i meant new bundlers</p>

Bundlers or pseudo bundlers (Kayak, Orbitz, Expedia) are basically selling "excess inventory" but of a finite inventory.</p>

<p>Media bundlers and pseudo-bundlers can sell "excess inventory" of an infinite inventory.  Making each individual transaction minute in comparison to the overall market.</p>

<p>Every TV turned off is idle inventory which can be accessed by making the marginal cost very, very, very low. </p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38307405">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-1" data-role="likes">1</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38307405">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-38382879">    <div data-role="post-content" class="post-content ">        <div class="indicator"></div>                        <div class="avatar hovercard">            <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="user" data-action="profile" data-user="458593">                <img src="avatar92(14).jpg" alt="Avatar">            </a>        </div>                <div class="post-body">            <header>                                    <span class="publisher-anchor-color"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="profile" data-user="458593">ShanaC</a></span>                                                 <span class="bullet">•</span>                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38382879" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago">2 years ago</a>                                                    <span class="bullet">•</span>                    <span data-role="edit-hide">                                    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-hide" data-action="collapse">Hide</a>        <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="visibility-toggle visibility-show" data-action="collapse" style="display:none">Show</a>                        </span>                    <div class="dropdown" data-role="menu">                            <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#"><span class="caret"></span></a>    <ul class="dropdown-menu invisible">                    <li><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="flag">Flag as inappropriate</a></li>            </ul>                    </div>                            </header>            <div class="post-message publisher-anchor-color " data-role="message">                                    <p><a href="http://disqus.com/JLM/" class="mention">JLM:&nbsp;</a>Airline tickets are equivlent.

<p>1) cable will be data providers plain and simple. they could be bundlers too and probably will maintain one that some of their customers will subscribe to.</p>

<p>3) networks will offer an ala carte single network subscription</p>

<p>4) the retailers will be the software that runs on the internet connected TVs, appleTV, boxee, and others</p>                            </div>                        <footer>                        <menu>        <li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:38418856">            <span style="display:none;" class="realtime-replies"></span>            <a style="display:none;" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="btn small" data-action="load-queued-posts"></a>             <!-- Realtime notification about new replies -->        </li>        <li class="voting" data-role="voting">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-up " data-action="upvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="likes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote up</span>    </a>    <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" class="vote-down " data-action="downvote">        <span class="updatable count count-0" data-role="dislikes">0</span>        <span class="control">Vote down</span>    </a>        </li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="reply"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="reply">Reply</a></li>        <li class="bullet">•</li>                <li class="share">            <a class="toggle">Share ›</a>            <ul>                <li class="twitter"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</a></li>                <li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</a></li>                <li class="link"><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#comment-38418856">Link</a></li>            </ul>        </li>    </menu>                </footer>        </div>                <div data-role="blacklist-form"></div>    </div>    <!-- Child comments are appended here -->    <ul data-role="children" class="children"></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>            <div class="load-more" data-role="more" style="">                <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/monopolies-retransmission-fees-and-screwing-customers.html#" data-action="more-posts" class="btn">Load more comments</a>            </div>        </div>            </section>    <section id="community" style="display:none" data-role="main"><div>    <div class="primary">                <h3>Top Discussions on A VC</h3>                <div data-role="top-threads"><ol id="top-threads" class="loading"></ol></div>    </div>    <div class="secondary">        <h3>Top Commenters</h3>        <div data-role="top-users"><ol id="top-users" class="loading"></ol></div>    </div></div></section>    <section id="dashboard" style="display:none" data-role="main">        <!-- Dashboard goes here -->        <!-- Default message if there are no notifications or activity to show -->        <p style="line-height: 1.4">Nothing for you here ... yet.
